Q1:

PART A

- sigsetjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int savesign)
  This function saves the stack context and CPU state within the sigjmp_buf struct. Essentially, it bookmarks a section
  of code to return to later in the program's execution. When directly called, it returns 0, but if called with
  siglongjmp, it returns a user-defined value.

- siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val)
  This function jumps to a specified code location and restores the CPU state indicated by env. This jump takes the
  program back to where sigsetjmp was called. The return value of sigsetjmp after arriving from siglongjmp will be the
  user-defined val.

PART B

In sigsetjmp, the savesigs parameter determines whether to save the signal mask. If savesigs is 0, the current signal
mask isn't saved. If it's non-zero, the signal mask is saved.
If the signal mask was saved in sigsetjmp, then siglongjmp will also restore it when called.

Q2:

For a web server, handling multiple requests together is crucial. We can assign a thread to each request, allowing us
to manage them concurrently. This setup offers flexibility in scheduling threads based on priority if needed. Since
requests mainly involve computational tasks like loading and sending files, the risk of one thread blocking others due
to I/O operations is low. Moreover, user-level threads provide low overhead during context switching, enhancing the
server's responsiveness.

Q3:

ADVANTAGES

- Isolation: Each tab operates within its own process, ensuring that if one tab crashes, it doesn't affect the others.
- Security: With separate memory spaces for each tab, security is enhanced as attackers cannot easily access the memory
  of other tabs.
- Independent Memory Space: Memory leaks in one tab do not impact the performance of other tabs.

DISADVANTAGES

- High Overhead: Switching between tabs incurs a higher overhead as it involves switching between processes, which
  takes more time compared to switching between kernel-level threads.
- Complex Inter-Process Communication (IPC): IPC mechanisms between processes are more complex than managing
  kernel-level threads, increasing system complexity.
- Slow Process Creation: Creating a new process is generally slower than creating a new thread, leading to higher
  overhead in setting up new memory spaces and resources.

Q4:

When typing the kill command in the shell with the PID of Shotwell (90757), several interrupts and signals occur.
Firstly, each character typed on the keyboard generates an external interrupt, which the operating system handles and
passes to the shell. After entering the command, pressing the Enter key triggers the execution.
The shell then displays the input buffer and parses the kill command.
Upon activation, the operating system sends a SIGTERM signal to the process with the specified ID (PID 90757),
initiating termination.
If Shotwell hasn't defined a custom handler for the SIGTERM signal, the kernel terminates the process.

Q5:

'Real Time' refers to the actual elapsed time from the start to the completion of a process, as measured by a clock.
'Virtual Time' refers to the time a process spends actively executing on the CPU, excluding any waiting periods or
idle time.

For example, when sending a document to the printer, 'Real Time' is the total time from the moment the print job is
initiated until it is fully completed, as measured by a physical clock. In contrast, 'Virtual Time' in this scenario
refers to the CPU time used by the computer or printer to process the print job, excluding any time the process spends
waiting in the print queue or being idle.
